A. 
To retrieve this information, you would need access to the actual RFAM database and use SQL queries to extract the relevant data. The "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger can be obtained by querying for the specific biological name "Panthera tigris sumatrae" in the taxonomy table. The number of types of tigers can be determined by counting the unique tiger species in the taxonomy table.

Here's a general outline of the SQL queries you would use:

1. To find the "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger:

sql
SELECT ncbi_id
FROM taxonomy
WHERE species_name = 'Panthera tigris sumatrae';


2. To count the number of types of tigers:

sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ncbi_id)
FROM taxonomy
WHERE family_name = 'Felidae' AND genus_name = 'Panthera' AND species_name LIKE 'Panthera tigris%';


B.
SELECT
  TABLE_NAME,
  COLUMN_NAME,
  CONSTRAINT_NAME,
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
  REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE
  TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name';


C.
SELECT
  t.species_name,
  MAX(LENGTH(rs.dna_sequence)) AS max_sequence_length
FROM
  rfamseq rs
JOIN
  taxonomy t ON rs.ncbi_id = t.ncbi_id
WHERE
  t.species_name LIKE '%rice%'
GROUP BY
  t.species_name
ORDER BY
  max_sequence_length DESC
LIMIT 1;

D.
SELECT
  r.family_accession_id,
  r.family_name,
  MAX(LENGTH(rs.dna_sequence)) AS max_sequence_length
FROM
  rfamseq rs
JOIN
  rfamfamily r ON rs.rfam_acc = r.rfam_acc
GROUP BY
  r.family_accession_id, r.family_name
HAVING
  max_sequence_length > 1000000
ORDER BY
  max_sequence_length DESC
LIMIT 15 OFFSET 120; -- Assuming you want the 9th page with 15 results per page
